Investigating Candidate Genes involved in Esophageal Cancer through Integrated Transcriptomics Data Analysis

# Background
Esophageal cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Through this project, we hope to contribute to the development of precision medicine strategies for esophageal cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of cancer research. 
To address this, our project aims to identify and investigate candidate genes involved in esophageal cancer through integrated transcriptomics approach to identify differentially expressed genes between esophageal cancer and normal tissues. 
We will explore the functional relationships and interactions among these molecular entities, aiming to uncover novel therapeutic targets and drug-gene interactions. We will utilize public repositories such as TCGA and GEO to gather diverse datasets encompassing various stages and subtypes of esophageal cancer.

# Aims and Objectives
## General Objective
Identify novel candidate genes associated with epilepsy using integrative transcriptomic data analysis.
### Specific Objectives
Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with esophageal cancer and healthy controls.
Perform functional enrichment analysis to identify genes that are involved in related biological pathways and protein interaction networks.
